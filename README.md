# LinkedIn Automation Proof of Concept

⚠️ Educational Purpose Only

This project demonstrates browser automation architecture using Golang
and the Rod library. It focuses on stealth behavior simulation,
modular design, logging, and state management.

No real LinkedIn automation is performed.
All interactions occur on a mock local web page.

## Features
- Go + Rod browser automation
- Human-like delay simulation
- Modular architecture
- Structured logging
- State persistence

## How to Run
```bash
go run cmd/main.go
